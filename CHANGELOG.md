## 0.3.1
Performance & Stability Update

Critical Memory Leak Fixes:
- Fixed catastrophic memory leak from DispatchQueue.main.async accumulation in audio callbacks (iOS/macOS)
- Fixed retain cycle in plugin instance preventing deallocation (iOS/macOS)
- Fixed retain cycles in audio node callbacks by using weak self references (iOS/macOS)
- Fixed NotificationCenter observer leak by adding proper deinit cleanup (iOS/macOS)
- Fixed ring buffer index overflow that would cause eventual corruption
- Fixed StreamController memory leak in Dart output sink fallback
- Added proper cleanup of binary message handlers on stop
- Added buffer.clear() on stop to release memory immediately
- Optimized audio buffer conversion to reduce allocations per frame

Performance Improvements:
- Optimized audio pipeline to use Float64 throughout iOS/macOS, eliminating unnecessary Float32→Float64 conversions
- Removed unnecessary thread dispatch from audio callbacks, eliminating unbounded queue growth
- Reduced CPU overhead by eliminating Float32→Float64 conversion in audio processing
- Optimized buffer sizes based on latency mode (256-4096 samples)
- Improved thread synchronization for audio callbacks
- Optimized Dart output stream to avoid unnecessary Float64List allocations
- Eliminated per-frame List allocations in example app audio processing

Bug Fixes:
- Fixed critical pipeline setup bug in iOS/macOS (_isPipelineSetup flag now properly set)
- Fixed audio format mismatch crash on iOS/macOS (AVAudioEngine Float32 compatibility)
- Fixed latency change handling on miniaudio platforms (now properly restarts with new buffer)
- Fixed Web platform getFrameDuration calculation before audio start
- Fixed example app pubspec.yaml formatting issues
- Added missing flutter_lints dependency to example app

Platform Improvements:
- Added clipping protection for miniaudio platforms (Linux/Windows/Android) to prevent audio distortion
- Implemented dynamic latency switching without restart on all platforms
- Fixed Web platform buffer size configuration based on latency settings
- Improved ring buffer size management with minimum size guarantee

Code Quality:
- Fixed analyzer warnings and applied dart fix recommendations
- Removed debug print statements from production code
- Disabled latency dropdown in example app when audio is running
